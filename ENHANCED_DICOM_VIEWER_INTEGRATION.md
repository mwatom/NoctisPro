# Enhanced DICOM Viewer Integration

## Overview

This document describes the successful integration of PyQt5-like DICOM viewer functionality into the Django web application. The integration provides a comprehensive medical imaging viewer with advanced features similar to desktop applications but accessible through a web browser.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Advanced Image Display
- **Real-time windowing and leveling**: Interactive adjustment of window width and window level for optimal tissue contrast
- **Zoom and pan**: Smooth zooming and panning with mouse wheel and drag controls
- **Image inversion**: Toggle between normal and inverted image display
- **Preset window/level settings**: Quick access to common medical imaging presets (Lung, Bone, Soft Tissue, Brain)

### 2. Measurement Tools
- **Distance measurements**: Click and drag to measure distances between two points
- **Real-world measurements**: Automatic conversion from pixels to millimeters/centimeters using DICOM pixel spacing
- **Measurement persistence**: Save and reload measurements across sessions
- **Visual overlays**: Clear visualization of measurement lines and distance labels

### 3. Annotation System
- **Text annotations**: Click to add text annotations at specific image locations
- **Persistent annotations**: Annotations are saved and restored with the image
- **Visual markers**: Clear yellow text overlays for easy identification

### 4. Advanced Navigation
- **Multi-slice navigation**: Navigate through DICOM series using slider or mouse wheel
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Quick access to tools and functions via keyboard
- **Crosshair overlay**: Optional crosshair display for precise positioning

### 5. Tool Integration

   - Navigation controls for multi-slice viewing
   - Image information display panel

#### Key JavaScript Features
```javascript
// Real-time image processing
async function updateDisplay()
async function getProcessedImageData(dicomInfo)

// Interactive measurements
function startMeasurement(x, y)
function finishMeasurement()
function calculateDistance(start, end)

// Tool management
function handleToolClick(tool)
function updateCanvasCursor()

// DICOM file processing
async function processDicomFiles(files)
function extractDicomInfo(arrayBuffer)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **DICOM files not loading**: Ensure files have .dcm extension or proper DICOM headers
2. **Measurements not showing**: Check that pixel spacing is available in DICOM metadata
3. **Slow performance**: Large files may require time to process on server
4. **Session loss**: Measurements are stored in session, login status affects persistence

### Performance Optimization
- Image caching on server side
- Progressive loading for large series
- Optimized rendering for smooth interactions
- Lazy loading of non-visible images

## Conclusion

The enhanced DICOM viewer successfully integrates desktop-like functionality into the web-based Django application. It provides medical professionals with familiar tools and workflows while maintaining the accessibility and deployment advantages of a web application. The modular design allows for easy extension and integration with additional medical imaging features.
