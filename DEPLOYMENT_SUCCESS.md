# 🎉 NoctisPro PACS - Deployment Success!

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

Your NoctisPro PACS system has been successfully deployed! Here's what was resolved:

### 🔧 Issues Fixed:
1. **Hardcoded workspace paths** - Scripts now work from any directory
2. **Python dependency conflicts** - Added fallback to minimal requirements
3. **Systemd compatibility** - Created alternative deployment for non-systemd environments
4. **System dependencies** - Automated installation of required packages
5. **Error handling** - Improved resilience and fallback mechanisms

### 🚀 Current Status:
- ✅ **Django Application**: Running on http://localhost:8000
