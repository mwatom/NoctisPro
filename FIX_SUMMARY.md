# 🏥 NOCTIS PRO - Authentication Fix Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **500 Internal Server Error on Admin Password Input**
   - **Root Cause**: The admin panel was trying to set non-existent fields (`created_by`, `creation_timestamp`, `professional_status`) on the User model
   - **Fix Applied**: Removed these non-existent field assignments in `/workspace/admin_panel/views.py`

### 2. **User Verification Issue**
   - **Root Cause**: The form was setting `email_verified` instead of `is_verified` field
   - **Fix Applied**: Changed to use correct field `is_verified = True` for admin-created users

### 3. **Login Authentication Check**
   - **Verification**: Login requires both `is_active=True` AND `is_verified=True`
   - **Solution**: Ensured all admin-created users have both flags set to True

## ✅ Test Users Created

All test users have been created and verified to work without 500 errors:

### Admin User
- **Username**: `test_admin`
- **Password**: `TestPass123!`
- **Role**: Administrator
- **Status**: ✅ Active & Verified

### Radiologist
- **Username**: `test_radiologist`
- **Password**: `TestPass123!`
- **Role**: Radiologist
- **Facility**: Test Medical Facility
- **Status**: ✅ Active & Verified

### Facility User
- **Username**: `test_facility`
- **Password**: `TestPass123!`
- **Role**: Facility User
- **Facility**: Test Medical Facility
- **Status**: ✅ Active & Verified

### Default Admin (if exists)
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Status**: ✅ Active & Verified

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

1. **File**: `/workspace/admin_panel/views.py`
   - Line 201: Fixed `email_verified` → `is_verified`
   - Lines 202-204: Removed non-existent fields that were causing 500 errors

2. **Authentication Requirements**:
   - Users must have `is_active = True`
   - Users must have `is_verified = True`
   - Both conditions are now properly set for admin-created users

3. **Form Validation**: 
   - The `CustomUserCreationForm` already correctly sets both flags
   - No changes needed to forms.py

## ✅ Verification Complete

- ✅ Admin users can now create new users without 500 errors
- ✅ All user roles (admin, radiologist, facility) can login successfully
- ✅ Authentication works properly for all test users
- ✅ No database errors or missing field issues

## 🚀 How to Start the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
pip3 install --break-system-packages django djangorestframework django-cors-headers pillow pydicom numpy scipy scikit-image

# Run the server
cd /workspace
python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **User Creation**: When creating users through the admin panel, they are automatically set as active and verified
2. **Facility Users**: Must have a facility assigned (validation enforced)
3. **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters (Django default validators apply)
4. **Role-based Access**: Each role has specific permissions defined in the User model

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

The 500 error when entering admin password has been fixed, and all user roles can now login successfully without any errors.
