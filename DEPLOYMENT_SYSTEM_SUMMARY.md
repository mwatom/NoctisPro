✅ **Configuration Management**: Generates optimized configs for all components

## 🎯 Key Improvements Over Original Script

### Before (Original Script)
- ❌ Fixed for Ubuntu 24.04 only
- ❌ Hardcoded resource allocation
- ❌ Single deployment mode
- ❌ No system capability detection
- ❌ Basic error handling
- ❌ Limited configuration options

### After (Optimized System)
- ✅ **Universal OS Support**: Works on any Linux distribution
- ✅ **Intelligent Resource Management**: Adapts to available resources
- ✅ **Multiple Deployment Modes**: Docker, Native, Hybrid options
- ✅ **Advanced System Detection**: Comprehensive capability analysis
- ✅ **Robust Error Handling**: Backup, rollback, and recovery
- ✅ **Dynamic Configuration**: Generates optimal configs automatically

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### One-Command Deployment
```bash
# Automatically detects system and deploys optimally
./deploy_master.sh
```

### Test-Only Mode
```bash
# Validate system without deploying
./deploy_master.sh --test-only
```

### Manual Mode Selection
```bash
# Force specific deployment mode
FORCE_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=docker_minimal ./deploy_master.sh
```

## 📊 Generated Configurations

The system automatically generates optimized configurations:

```
deployment_configs/
├── nginx/nginx.optimized.conf          # Resource-aware Nginx config
├── systemd/noctis-*.service           # Optimized systemd services
├── docker/docker-compose.optimized.yml # Resource-limited Docker setup
├── env/.env.*                         # Environment templates
└── monitoring/health_check.sh         # Automated health monitoring
```

## 🎛️ Management Interface

After deployment, manage your system with:

```bash
# Generated management script
./manage_noctis.sh start|stop|restart|status|logs|health|update
```

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### Automatic Resource Allocation

| System Type | Web Workers | Memory Limits | Features Enabled |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| High-end (8GB+) | 8 workers | 2GB web, 1GB DB | All features, AI/ML |
| Mid-range (4GB) | 4 workers | 1GB web, 512MB DB | Core features |
| Low-end (2GB) | 2 workers | 512MB web, 256MB DB | Essential only |
| Minimal (1GB) | 1 worker | 256MB web | Basic functionality |

### Architecture Optimizations

- **x86_64**: Full feature set with pre-compiled wheels
- **ARM64**: Optimized build process with compilation fallbacks
- **Other**: Generic optimization with compatibility checks

## 🛡️ Security Enhancements

✅ **Service Isolation**: All services run as non-root users
✅ **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU constraints prevent resource exhaustion
✅ **Network Security**: Firewall configuration and port management
✅ **SSL/TLS Support**: Automatic certificate management
✅ **Access Control**: Role-based permissions and authentication
