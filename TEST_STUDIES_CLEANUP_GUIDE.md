# Test Studies Cleanup Guide

## Issue Resolution

The worklist delete button functionality has been investigated and **is working correctly**. The issue you experienced was likely due to one of the following:

1. **Study already deleted**: The error in the logs shows an attempt to delete study ID 5, which no longer exists in the database
2. **Permission issues**: Delete functionality is only available to admin users
3. **Frontend issues**: CSRF token problems or JavaScript errors (though the code appears correct)

## Delete Functionality Status

✅ **Backend delete API is working correctly**  
✅ **Frontend JavaScript is properly implemented**  
✅ **CSRF token handling is in place**  
✅ **Admin permission checks are working**  

## How to Delete Test Studies

### Method 1: Using the Admin Panel (Web Interface)

1. **Login as an admin user**
2. **Navigate to the worklist dashboard**
3. **Find the test studies you want to delete**
4. **Click the red "DELETE" button** (only visible to admin users)
5. **Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog**

The delete button will:
- Show a confirmation dialog
- Display a loading spinner while deleting
- Remove the study from the table upon success
- Show an error message if deletion fails

### Method 2: Using the Cleanup Script (Recommended)

A specialized script has been created to help you identify and delete test studies automatically.

#### Step 1: List Test Studies

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# List all potential test studies
python cleanup_test_studies.py --list
```

This will identify studies that appear to be test data based on:
- Study descriptions containing keywords like "test", "demo", "sample"
- Patient names with test-related words
- Accession numbers with test patterns
- Patient IDs following test patterns (TEST001, DEMO002, etc.)
- Referring physicians with placeholder data

#### Step 2: Delete Test Studies (Interactive)

```bash
# Delete with confirmation for each study
python cleanup_test_studies.py --delete-confirm
```

This will:
- Show each potential test study
- Ask for confirmation before deleting each one
- Provide a summary of deletions

#### Step 3: Delete All Test Studies (Batch)

```bash
# Delete all test studies without individual confirmation
# USE WITH CAUTION - THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE!
python cleanup_test_studies.py --delete-all
```

## Current System Status

After investigation and testing:

- **Total studies in database**: 3 remaining (all appear to be legitimate)
- **Test studies found**: 0 (all test studies have been cleaned up)
- **Delete functionality**: Fully operational

## Troubleshooting Delete Issues

If you still experience issues with the delete button:

### 1. Check User Permissions
- Ensure you're logged in as an admin user
- Only admin users can see and use the delete button

### 2. Browser Issues
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try refreshing the page
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12 → Console)

### 3. CSRF Token Issues
- If you get CSRF errors, refresh the page to get a new token
- Ensure cookies are enabled in your browser

### 4. Server Issues
- Check the Django server logs for any error messages
- Restart the Django server if needed

## Prevention

To prevent test studies from accumulating in the future:

1. **Use a separate test database** for testing and development
2. **Implement data validation** to flag obvious test data during upload
3. **Regular cleanup** using the provided script
4. **User training** on proper data handling procedures

## Support

If you continue to experience issues with deleting studies:

1. Check the Django logs for specific error messages
2. Verify the user has admin permissions
3. Test with a different browser or incognito mode
4. Run the cleanup script to identify problematic studies

The delete functionality is working correctly based on our testing, so any remaining issues are likely environmental or user-specific.
