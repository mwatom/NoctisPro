# ðŸŽ¯ SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS - WHAT TO DO NOW

## Your NoctisPro is ALREADY RUNNING!
âœ… Local access: http://localhost:8000  
âœ… Admin panel: http://localhost:8000/admin/ (admin/admin123)  
âœ… Auto-starts on boot: CONFIGURED  

## To Get Public Internet Access:

### Option A: Quick Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Get your ngrok auth token
# Go to: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
# Copy the token

# 2. Configure ngrok (replace YOUR_TOKEN with actual token)
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN_HERE

# 3. Restart the service
sudo /usr/local/bin/start-noctispro
```

After this, your site will be live at: **https://colt-charmed-lark.ngrok-free.app**

### Option B: Just Use Local Access
If you don't need public access right now, you're DONE! Just use:
- http://localhost:8000

## What Happens on Reboot:
âœ… Your system will automatically start NoctisPro  
âœ… No manual intervention needed  
âœ… It just works  

## Check Status Anytime:
```bash
# See if it's running
curl http://localhost:8000/health/

# Check processes
ps aux | grep manage.py
```

## That's It!
You're done. Your system works and auto-starts.
