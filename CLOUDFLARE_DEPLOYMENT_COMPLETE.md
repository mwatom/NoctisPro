## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Complete CloudFlare Setup
```bash
# Run the CloudFlare tunnel setup script
./cloudflare-tunnel-setup.sh

# Follow the prompts to:
# 1. Authenticate with CloudFlare
# 2. Create a tunnel
# 3. Configure your domain
# 4. Set up DNS records
```

### Step 2: Deploy with Docker
```bash
# Run the integrated deployment script
./deploy_cloudflare_integrated.sh

# This will:
# - Validate your system
# - Configure DICOM networking
# - Deploy all services with Docker
# - Set up CloudFlare tunnel integration
```

### Step 3: Access Your System
- **Local Web Interface**: http://localhost:8000
- **Local Admin Panel**: http://localhost:8000/admin/
- **Default Login**: admin / NoctisAdmin2024!

Once CloudFlare is configured:
- **Public Web Interface**: https://noctis.yourdomain.com
- **Public Admin Panel**: https://admin.yourdomain.com
- **Public DICOM Endpoint**: dicom.yourdomain.com:11112

## 📡 DICOM Configuration for Remote AE

### Your DICOM Server Details
- **AE Title**: `NOCTIS_SCP`
- **Port**: `11112`
- **Local IP**: Detected automatically during setup
- **Public Domain**: Your CloudFlare domain (when configured)

### Pre-configured AE Titles for Testing
| AE Title | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| CT_MAIN_01 | Main Hospital CT Scanner | Active |
| MRI_ER_01 | Emergency MRI Unit | Active |
| XRAY_PORT_01 | Portable X-Ray Unit | Active |
| US_DEPT_01 | Ultrasound Department | Active |
| CLINIC_EXT_01 | External Clinic | Active |

### Configuring Your Imaging Device

#### For Any DICOM Device:
1. **Destination AET**: `NOCTIS_SCP`
2. **Destination IP**: Your server's IP or CloudFlare domain
3. **Destination Port**: `11112`
4. **Source AET**: One of the registered AE titles above (or add your own)

#### Connection Testing:
```bash
# Test DICOM port locally
timeout 5 bash -c "</dev/tcp/localhost/11112" && echo "DICOM accessible"

# Test from remote device (replace IP)
timeout 5 bash -c "</dev/tcp/YOUR_SERVER_IP/11112" && echo "Remote DICOM accessible"
```

## 🛠️ Management Commands

### Service Management
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# View service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Restart specific service
docker-compose restart dicom_receiver
```

### CloudFlare Tunnel Management
```bash
# Start CloudFlare tunnel (if not using Docker)
sudo systemctl start cloudflared-tunnel

# Check tunnel status
sudo systemctl status cloudflared-tunnel

# View tunnel logs
sudo journalctl -u cloudflared-tunnel -f
```

### DICOM Monitoring
```bash
# View DICOM receiver logs
tail -f logs/dicom_receiver.log

# Monitor DICOM connections
grep "C-STORE" logs/dicom_receiver.log | tail -20

# Check DICOM port accessibility
netstat -tlnp | grep 11112
```

## 🌍 CloudFlare vs ngrok Comparison

### CloudFlare Tunnel Advantages
- ✅ **Consistent URLs**: Never change, unlike ngrok's dynamic URLs
- ✅ **No subscription needed**: Free tier available
- ✅ **Better performance**: CloudFlare's global network
- ✅ **SSL included**: Automatic HTTPS certificates
- ✅ **Multiple subdomains**: Different endpoints for different services
- ✅ **Professional appearance**: Your own domain instead of random strings

### Integration with Existing ngrok
You can run both simultaneously:
- **CloudFlare**: For consistent, professional access
- **ngrok**: For temporary testing or backup access

## 🔒 Security Features

### DICOM Security
- **AE Title Validation**: Only registered facilities can send images
- **Connection Logging**: All connection attempts are logged
- **Facility Management**: Admin control over which devices can connect
- **Network Isolation**: Docker network isolation for services

### Web Security
- **HTTPS by default**: CloudFlare provides SSL certificates
- **Admin access control**: Django admin authentication
- **Environment isolation**: Docker container security
- **Firewall configuration**: Automatic port management

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### CloudFlare Tunnel Not Working
```bash
# Check tunnel status
sudo systemctl status cloudflared-tunnel

# View tunnel logs
sudo journalctl -u cloudflared-tunnel -f

# Restart tunnel
sudo systemctl restart cloudflared-tunnel
```

#### DICOM Images Not Appearing
1. Check DICOM logs: `tail -f logs/dicom_receiver.log`
2. Verify AE title is registered in admin panel
3. Test DICOM port: `timeout 5 bash -c "</dev/tcp/localhost/11112"`
4. Check facility is active in Django admin

#### Docker Services Not Starting
```bash
# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View specific service logs
docker logs noctis_web
docker logs noctis_dicom
docker logs noctis_db

# Restart all services
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

#### Port Access Issues
```bash
# Check if ports are in use
netstat -tlnp | grep -E "8000|11112"

# Configure firewall
sudo ufw allow 8000/tcp
sudo ufw allow 11112/tcp
```
