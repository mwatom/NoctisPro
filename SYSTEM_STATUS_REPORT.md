# Noctis Pro PACS - System Status Report

## âœ… FIXED ISSUES

### 1. Three.js CDN Loading Issues (DICOM Viewer)
- **Problem**: CDN URLs for Three.js were returning HTML/text instead of JavaScript, causing MIME type mismatches
- **Solution**: 
  - Downloaded Three.js v0.160.0 and OrbitControls locally to `/workspace/static/js/vendor/three/`
  - Updated DICOM viewer template to use local files instead of CDN
  - Fixed Django template syntax for static file loading
  - Copied files to staticfiles directory and ran collectstatic

### 2. Admin Worklist Delete Button
- **Problem**: Delete button was placeholder with no actual functionality
- **Solution**:
  - Implemented proper `deleteItem()` function with CSRF protection
  - Added proper error handling and user feedback
  - Connected to existing backend delete APIs
  - Added loading states and confirmation dialogs

### 3. Missing JavaScript Functions
- **Problem**: Several critical functions were missing (showToast, fallbackToDesktop)
- **Solution**:
  - Added comprehensive `showToast()` notification system to DICOM viewer
  - Added `fallbackToDesktop()` placeholder function
  - Added CSRF token utilities to admin dashboard
  - Loaded button-utils.js for enhanced button functionality

### 4. Static File Serving
- **Problem**: Static files not being served in production mode
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed Django settings to enable static file serving
  - Added `SERVE_MEDIA_FILES` environment variable support
  - Updated DEBUG default to enable development features
  - Ensured all static files are properly collected

### 5. Missing Dependencies
- **Problem**: Multiple Python packages missing (numpy, scikit-image, celery, etc.)
- **Solution**:
  - Created virtual environment
  - Installed all required dependencies:
    - django, pillow, pydicom, requests
    - numpy, scipy, matplotlib
    - scikit-image, opencv-python
