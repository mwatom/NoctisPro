# DICOM Viewer Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. **Images Not Displaying**
- **Problem**: Main viewer function was redirecting to desktop launcher instead of serving web viewer
- **Fix**: Modified `viewer()` function in `views.py` to serve the web template directly
- **Result**: Images now display properly in the web interface

### 2. **Patient Details Not Showing**
- **Problem**: Patient information was not being properly passed to the template
- **Fix**: Enhanced `web_viewer()` function to pass study_id to template and improved JavaScript patient info display
- **Result**: Patient name, study date, and modality now display correctly in the topbar

### 3. **Rotating Loading Circle Stuck**
- **Problem**: Loading spinners would get stuck if errors occurred during operations
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling and button state reset functions
- **Added**: Global error handlers to catch unhandled errors and reset UI state
- **Result**: Loading spinners now reset properly on errors

### 4. **Buttons Not Working**
- **Problem**: Button event handlers were not properly initialized or would break on errors
- **Fix**: Added `initializeButtonHandlers()` function with proper event listener setup
- **Added**: Button state validation and re-initialization on errors
- **Result**: All buttons now work correctly with proper feedback

### 5. **Local DICOM Loading Not Working**
- **Problem**: File upload functionality had issues with error handling and state management
- **Fix**: Enhanced upload error handling and progress indication
- **Added**: Better file validation and chunked upload processing
- **Result**: Local DICOM files can now be uploaded and processed successfully

### 6. **Missing Dependencies**
- **Problem**: Required Python packages were not installed
- **Fix**: Installed all required dependencies including Django, pydicom, PIL, numpy, scipy
- **Result**: Server now runs without import errors

### 7. **File Path Issues**
- **Problem**: Database file paths didn't match actual DICOM file locations
- **Fix**: Added fallback file path resolution in `web_dicom_image()` view
- **Added**: Automatic file discovery using SOP Instance UID
- **Result**: Images load even if database paths are incorrect
