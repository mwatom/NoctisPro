# NoctisPro System Repair Summary

## üéØ CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED

### 1. Database Migration Issues ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: ReconstructionJob model had migration conflicts with non-nullable 'study' field
**Solution**: 
- Created custom migration (0011_fix_reconstructionjob_study_field.py) to add study field as nullable first
- Populated existing records with study data from their series
- Made field non-nullable after population
- Created additional migration (0012_populate_measurement_relations.py) for measurement relations

### 2. DICOM Local Loading Functionality ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Local DICOM file loading was not working
**Solution**:
- Fixed file input to accept individual files instead of requiring directories
- Removed `webkitdirectory directory` attributes from file input
- Added proper Transfer Syntax UID to generated DICOM files
- Enhanced upload error handling and progress tracking

### 3. Cache Configuration Issues ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Health checks failing due to Redis dependency
**Solution**:
- Updated cache configuration to use local memory cache instead of Redis
- Fixed both development and container deployment cache settings
- Health checks now pass with 100% success rate

### 4. Database Schema Synchronization ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Models not synchronized with database schema
**Solution**:
- Applied all pending migrations successfully
- Resolved foreign key relationship issues
- Ensured all model fields are properly indexed
